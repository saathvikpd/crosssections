Using the distribution of cross-sectional areas collected from stochastically generated planes of intersection as unique identifers for 3D structures:

- Generates a random 3D structure defined by a specific set of equations (for simplicity)
- Generates a series of random planes of intersection
- Computes cross sectional areas generated by the intersections
- Plots distribution of areas
